Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. The 
function should find all the quadruplets that sum up to the target sum an returns a two dimensional array of all
these quadruplets in no particular order.

If no four numbers sum up to the target Sum, the function should return an empty array.
 

Sample Input:
 
  array = [7, 6, 4, -1, 1, 2]
  targetSum = 16

Sample Output:

  [[7, 6, 4, -1], [7, 6, 1, 2]] //the quadruplets could be ordered differently
