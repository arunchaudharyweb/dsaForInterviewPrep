Given two non-empty array of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is the
subsequence of the first one.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but they are in the 
same order as they appear in the array. For instance, the numbers [1,3,4] form a subsequence of the array,
[1,2,3,4], and so do the numbers [2,4]. Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both 
valid subsequences of the array.

Sample Input:
  
   array = [5,1,22,25,6,-1,8,10]
   sequence = [1,6,-1,10]

Sample Output:
   True
