You are given an array of integers and an integer. Write a function that moves all the instances of that integer
in the array to the end of the array.

The function should perform this in place (i.e. it should mutate the input array) and doesn't need to maintain
the order of other integers.

Sample Input:
   array = [2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2]
   toMove = 2

Sample Output:
  [1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] //the numbers 1, 3, 4 could be ordered differently
