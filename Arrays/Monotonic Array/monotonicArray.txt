Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean whether the array is monotonic.

An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are entirely non incresing or non 
decreasing.

Sample Input:
  
  array = [-1, -5, -10, -1100, -1100, -1101, -1102, -9001]

Sample Output:

 true
