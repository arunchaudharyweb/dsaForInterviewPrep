Write a function that takes in two non-empty array of integers, finds the pair of numbers(one from each array)
whose absolute differnce is closest to zero and returns an array containg these two numbers, with the number 
from first array in the first position.

You can assume that there will only be one pair of numbers with the smallest difference.

Sample Input:
  
  arrayOne = [-1, 5, 10, 20, 28, 3]
  arrayTwo = [26, 134, 135, 15, 17]

Sample Output:

  [28, 26]
