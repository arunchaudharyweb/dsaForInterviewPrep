You are given three inputs, all of which are instances of an AncestralTree class that have an ancestor property
pointing to their youngest ancestor. The first input is the top ancestor in the ancestral tree ( i.e. the only 
instance that has no ancestor -- its ancestor property points to None/null), and the other two inputs are
descendents in the ancestral tree.

Write a function that returns the youngest common ancestor to the two descendents.

Sample input:

  // The nodes are from ancestral tree below.
  topAncestor = Node A 
  descendentOne = Node E 
  descendentTwo = Node I 
           A
       /       \
      B         C
    /   \     /   \
   D     E   F     G
 /   \
H     I

Sample Output:

  Node B
