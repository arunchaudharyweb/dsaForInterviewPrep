You are given an array of integers where each integer represents a jump of its value in the array. For instance,
the integer 2 represents a jump of two indices forward in the array; the integer -3 represents a jump of three
indices backward in the array.

If a jump spills past the array's bounds, it wraps over to the other side. For instace, a jump of -1 at index 0
brings us to the last index in the array. Similarly, a jump of 1 at last index in the array brings us to the 
index 0.

Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether the jumps in the array forms a single cycle. A 
single cycle occurs if, starting at any index in the array and following the jumps, every element in the array
is visited exactly once before landing back on the starting index.

Sample Input:
  
  array = [2, 3, 1, -4, -4, 2]

Sample Output:

  true
