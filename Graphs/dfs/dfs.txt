You are given a Node class that has a name and an array of optional children nodes. When put together nodes form 
an acyclic-tree-like structure.
Implement the depthFirstSearch method on the node class, which takes in an empty array, traverses the tree using
depth first search approach (specially navigating the tree from left to right) stores all of the nodes' names 
into the input array and returns it.

Sample input:
 
Graph =            A 
            /      |      \
          B        C        D 
      /      \           /     \
    E          F        G        H 
            /    \        \
          I        J        K

Sample output:

 ["A", "B", "E", "F", "I", "J", "C", "D", "G", "K", "H"]
