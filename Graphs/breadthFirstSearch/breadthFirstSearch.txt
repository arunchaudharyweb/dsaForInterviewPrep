You are given a class that has a name and an array of option children nodes. When put together nodes form an
acyclic tree-like structure.

Implement the breadthFirstSearch method on the node class, which takes in an empty array, traverses the tree
using the Breadth-first appraoach(specially navigating the tree from left to right), stores all of the nodes' 
names in the input array and returns it.

Sample Input:

            A
       /    |    \
      B     C     D
    /   \       /   \
   E     F     G     H
       /   \    \
      I     J    K

Sample Output:
     
    ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K"]
