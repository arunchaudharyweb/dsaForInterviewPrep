You're given a two dimensional array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height and width containing only 0s and
1s. Each 0 represents land, and each 1 represents part of a river. A river consists of any number of 1s that are
either horizontally or vertically adjacent(but not diagonally adjacent). The number of adjacent 1s forming a
river determine its size.

Write a function that returns an array of the sizes of all rivers represented in the input matrix. The sizes
don't need to be in any particular order.

Sample Input:

matrix = [
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
]


Sample Output:
 
  [1, 2, 2, 2, 5] //the numbers could be ordered differently
