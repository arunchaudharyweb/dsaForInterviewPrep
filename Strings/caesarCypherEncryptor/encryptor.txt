Given a non empty string of lowercase letters and a non-negative integer representing a key, write a function 
that returns a new string obtained by shifting every letter in the input string by k position in the alphabet
where k is the key.

Note that alphabets should "wrap" around the alphabet, in other words the letter z shifted by one should return 
the letter a.

Sample Input:
  string = "xyz"
  key = 2

Sample Output:
  string = "zab"
