Write a function that takes in the head of a singly linked list, reverses the list in place (i.e. doesn't create a
brand new list and returns its new head).

Each linked list node has an integer value as well a next node pointing to the next node in the list or to None/null
if it's the tail of the list.

You can assume that the input linked list will always have at least one node; in other words, the head will never 
be None/null.

Sample input:

    head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 // the head node with value 0

Sample Output:

    5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 // the head node with value 5
