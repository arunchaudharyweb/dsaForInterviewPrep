Linked List Constsruction
Write a DoublyLinkedList class that has a head and a tail, both of which points either to a linked list Node or
None/null. The class should support:
  - Setting the head and tail of the linked list
  - Inserting nodes before and after other nodes as well as at given positions
  - Removing given nodes and removing nodes with given values
  - Searching for nodes with given values

Each node has an integer value as well as prev node and next node both of which can point either to another
Node or None/null.
