Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List and an integer k and removes the kth node from
the end of the list. 

Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well a next node pointing to the next node in the list or to None/
null if it's the tail of the list.

You can assume that the input linked list will always have at least two nodes and more specifically at least k 
nodes.

Sample Input:  
   
   head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 // the head node with value 0
   k = 4

Sample Output:
 
   // No output required
   // The 4th node from the end of the list (the node with value 6)

    0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9
