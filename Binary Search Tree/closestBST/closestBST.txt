Find the closest element in Binary Search Tree

Write a function that takes in a BST and a target integer value and return the closest value to the target value
contained in the BST.
You can assume that there will be only one closest value.

Each BST node has an integer value, a left child node and a right child node. A node is said to be a valid BST
node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node
to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right and its children nodes
are valid BST nodes themselves or none/null.

Sample input:

tree =    10
       /      \
      5        15
    /   \     /   \
   2     5   13    22
  /            \
 1              14
 target = 12

 Sample output = 13
