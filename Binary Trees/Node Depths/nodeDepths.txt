The distance between a node in a Binary tree and the tree's root is called the node's depth.

Write a function that takes in a Binary tree and returns the sum of its nodes' depths. Each binary tree has an
integer value, a left child node and a right child node. Children nodes can either be binarytree nodes themselves
or None/null.

Sample Input:

  tree =         1
            /         \
          2             3
       /      \      /     \
     4          5  6         7
   /   \
  8     9

Sample Output:
  16
  //The depth of the node with value 2 is 1.
  //The depth of the node with value 3 is 1.
  //The depth of the node with value 4 is 2.
  //Etc..
  //Summing all these depths yield 16.
