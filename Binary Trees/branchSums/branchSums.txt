Write a function that takes in a binary tree and return a list of its branch sums ordered from leftmost branch
sum to the rightmost branch sum.

A brnach sum is the sum of all values in a binary tree branch. A binary tree branch is a path  of nodes in a 
tree that starts at the root node and ends at any leaf node.

Each binary tree has an integer value, a left child node and a right child node. Children nodes can either be
BinaryTree nodes themselves or none/null.

Sample Input:

Tree =      1
        /       \
      2           3
   /    \      /     \
  4       5   6       7
 / \     /
8   9   10

Sample Output:
[15, 16, 18, 10, 11]
