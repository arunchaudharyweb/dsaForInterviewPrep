The fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is 0, the second number is 1 and
the nth number is the sum of (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns
the nth fibonacci number.

Important Note: the fibonacci sequence is defined with its first two numbers as F0 = 0 and F1 = 1. For the
purpose of this question the first fibonacci number is F0; therefore, getnthFib(1) = 0, getnthFib(1) = 1, etc.

Sample Input:
 n = 6

Sample Output:
 n = 5
