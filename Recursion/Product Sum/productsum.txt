Write a function that takes in an special array and return its product sum. A special array is a non empty array
that contains eithers integers or other special arrays. The product sum of a special array is the sum of its
elements, where special arrays inside it are summed themselves and then multiplied by their level of depth.

For example: The product sum of [x, y] is x + y; the product sum of [x, [y, z]] is x + 2y + 2z.

Sample Input:
   array = [5, 2 , [7, -1], 3, [6, [-13, 8], 4]]

Sample Output:
   12 // calculated as 5 + 2 + 2(7 - 1) + 3 + 2(6 + 3(-13 + 8) + 4)
